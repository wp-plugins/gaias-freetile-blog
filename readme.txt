Gaia Rendering's FTB Blog is intended for a developer to impliment as it requires additions and changes to theme files

Please read the Read Me file

Gaia FTB (Freetile Blog) Blog creates a custom post type that can be filtered by custom taxonomy (dynamically updated) and CAN randomly set the post width to either X, X*2, or X*3.  It also uses the default WP featured image if present.

You can also use the default WordPress posts if you don't want to use the CPT included.

Turning off 'show title' and 'show excerpt' essentally turn Gaia FTB blog into an image wall that randomly CAN set the width of the images.

Note: your must set the 'Use default Posts or the Gaia Free Tile CPT?' options to the correct setting if you are using either the php or the shortcode method of displaying the output.
